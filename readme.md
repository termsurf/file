## Summary

This repo collects files of all types (images, videos, code, documents, etc.), so you can use them to test your parsers, converters, and other tools which deal with various types of files. The files are in the `base` folder.

These files were either manually created or collected from various places across the web.

Many of the larger files or binary files are stored through git LFS, so download them all with:

```
git lfs fetch --all
```
