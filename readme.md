## Summary

This repo collects files of all types (images, videos, code, documents, etc.), so you can use them to test your parsers, converters, and other tools which deal with various types of files. The files are in the `base` folder.

These files were either manually created or collected from various places across the web.

Many of the larger files or binary files are stored through git LFS, so download them all with:

```
git lfs fetch --all
```

Unless any copyright restrictions come up, all content is distributed under [CC-BY-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/), meaning you can use it with attribution and not make derivatives, so as to avoid splintering the project. If you do anything more than build parsers and tools for processing files, you might want to double check the license of the original file by finding it on Google, but not necessary unless you basically are selling the file or advertising with it directly pretty much.
